# EvolutionarySemanticRule

This work aims to contribute to the research aimed at combining symbolic AI, machine learning, computational intelligence with a special emphasis on having humans/domain experts in the loop.

This repository contains the code and the dataset of a mini research we conducted aimed at extracting semantic rules from a dataset via evolutionary novelty search. 

The code in this repository implements a simple demonstrator of evolutionary novelty search for semantic rule definition for object recognition. It is an interactive human-machine cooperative framework.

To start the server simply run "python main.py". Then open a browser and connect to the server address (default is "localhost:5000").

The Jupyter notebook can be used to analyse the results of the evolutionary processes.

This work was presented at ICT.OPEN2019 (https://ict-research.nl/ict-open/). For more information please look at the presentation in the "ppt" folder and please do not hesitate to contact me.
